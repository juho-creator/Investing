# Base Effect
The phenomenon where the current consumer price appears to have increased significantly even with a small rise due to low consumer price in the previous year.
</br></br></br>

### Example
Comparing the energy and import prices in the US between 2020 and 2021
1. Increase in energy prices (rise in oil prices)
2. Increase in import prices due to the weakening of the US dollar (decline in the dollar index) 

- The **base effect** occurred, making the price increase seem larger than it was due to the low prices in 2020.
- Inflation occurred as a result of base effect and pentup demand existing simultaneously.
</br></br></br>

# Federal Reserve's 2021 Economic Outlook
The Federal Reserve thought the 2021 consumer price increase as transitory. This is because it deemed it impractical to set interest rates based on the volatility of oil prices; instead, it is more appropriate to assess genuine inflation based on employment indicators and wage trends.
