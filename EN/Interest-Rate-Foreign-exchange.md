# The Relationship Between Interest Rate Differentials and Exchange Rates

Exchange rates represent the relative value of currencies.
When a country raises its base interest rate, the supply of that country's currency decreases, leading to an increase in the value of its currency.

In 2020, due to the coronavirus, the US employment rate dropped by 10%, leading to an economic downturn. [[1]](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/employment-rate) </br>
This was overcome by quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve and fiscal spending by the Biden administration to recover the economy.

Unfortunately, excessive lending, spending, and money supply led to hyperinflation, with the US Consumer Price Index reaching 9.1% in 2022. [[2]](https://kr.investing.com/economic-calendar/cpi-733)

From 2022 to 2023, the Federal Reserve aggressively raised the base interest rate from 0.25% to 5.5% through 5 baby steps, 2 big steps, and 4 giant steps. [[3]](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS)

South Korea also raised its base rate to 3.5% in 2022 as the CPI recorded 6.3%, in an effort to correct inflation. [[4]](https://kr.investing.com/economic-calendar/south-korean-cpi-467)

Considering the exchange rate and prices, it might be possible to raise the base interest rate, but considering the current household debt ratio in Korea is 203%, there are concerns of an economic downturn, hence the base rate is being kept on hold.

As of now (April 4, 2024), the Korean CPI is at 3.1%, indicating a significant decrease in prices. However, there is a 2% interest rate differential between the US and Korea, with rates at 5.5% and 3.5% respectively. This interest rate differential between the US and Korea has led to the exchange rate rising by nearly 10% over the past year, with $1 = 1380 KRW. [[7]](https://www.investing.com/currencies/usd-krw)

In summary, the adjustments of the base interest rates by the US and Korea according to their respective economic situations have led to a differential in interest rates between the two countries, directly impacting the exchange rate. As of 2024, the higher interest rate in the US compared to Korea has resulted in an increase in the value of the dollar, and consequently, a rise in the USD/KRW exchange rate.</br></br>
