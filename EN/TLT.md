- FED's series of rise in interest rate to combat inflation (with highest CPI being 9.1%) ever since 2022 has caused the US treasury bond to plummet. </br></br></br></br>

- Fortunately, the CPI came down from its peak of 9.1% down to 3.5%.
- However, with the US CPI rising to 3.5% in 2024, there are concerns on FED raising interest rates to reach its target CPI of 2%. </br></br></br></br>
Here are several risks posed by investing in the TLT right now :

1. Unsettlement of inflation
There are concerns on sticky inflation with the rise in CPI value this year.
If federal reserve decides to increase interest rate to settle inflation,
a 1% increase in interest rate would cause TLT to decline by -16.34% (effective duration of TLT).

2. Foreign exchange rate
Currently, 1USD = 1385.60KRW which is a very high foreign exchange rate.
If foreign exchange rate come down, I'd be incuring loss from finalizing my profit from USD to KRW.

3. Credibility issue of US treasury bond
Currently, the US Dollar stands as the most dominant key currency and its treasury has a high bond rating of AAA~AA+. However, given the fact that the total US debt is $34T (that is 121% of it's current GDP) the ability of america to pay back its debt is highly questionable.
On top of that China, the main holder of US treasury bond has started selling around $200billion worth since 2022 showing distrust to the US treasury bond.In extreme cases, the public distrust of the US dollar may cause the treasury bond to plummet.
</br></br></br></br>

Regardless of the potential risk of raising interest rate, I still think there's alot of opportunity for the following reasons :

- According to the TLT ETF report from blackrock, the effective duration was around 16.7%. Hence every 1% change in interest rate would cause TLT price change of 16.7%. Considering the fact that interest rate has reached its all time high in 10years, I see this as an opportunity that will not happen very often.
- Even if the interest rate were to rise, dividend of TLT would increase as well. Hence, since I'm planning to wait until interest comes down, I'll just be getting more dividend in the process of waiting.
- The US treasury bond has a trustworthy high credit rating of AAA~AA+,
