# Changes in the High Yield Bond Market When Interest Rates Rise
1. Short-Term Bonds
   If interest rates rise:
   - **Long-Term Bonds**: Prices fall and the dividends are relatively lower compared to existing bonds.
   - **Short-Term Bonds**: When they mature, investors can reinvest at higher interest rates for more dividends.
   </br></br>

2. High Yield
   High Yield Rate = Government Bond Yield + Spread
   </br>
   The trend of the spread is key rather than the government bond yield.
