# Understanding the US Dollar

## History of the US Dollar
- The US dollar was pegged to gold during the Bretton Woods Agreement from the mid-1940s to the early 1970s to stabilize the dollar and international exchange rates.
- Since the collapse of the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971, the US dollar's value has gradually depreciated.
</br>

## USD Index
- The USD Index measures the value of the US dollar against a basket of six foreign currencies: </br>
  Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, and Swedish Krona.
</br></br></br>


## Why is the US dollar considered as a safe asset class? 
- Emerging countries borrow in USD for development, leading to increased USD value during global crises as debts are repaid. 
</br>
If global economic crisis occur, there are more people who are forced to sell their factories and buy usd to pay back debt.  </br>
Hence the value of the dollar increases during global financial crisis
</br></br></br>

</br>

## Why is Crude Oil considered as risky asset?
The price of crude oil only increases when the economic situation is great. otherwise the price may plummet.
</br></br>


## Relationship between USD and Crude Oil
Since crude oil can only be traded using the USD, if the purchasing power of US dollar were to increase, we could use less dollars to buy crude oil, hence the
price of crude oil falls and vice versa. Hence we could conclude that the price of crude oil is inversely proportional to the purchasing power of the dollar.

This fixed currency for oil trading is what stablizes the valuation of the US dollar.
