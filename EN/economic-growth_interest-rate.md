# Impact of Economic Growth and Interest Rates on the Stock Market
The relationship between interest rates and the stock market is not direct or simple. </br>
The impact of interest rates on the stock market can vary depending on the broader economic context. </br></br>

Let's explore different scenarios to understand the nuances of how the stock market can react:
</br></br></br>

### Scenario 1: Stock Prices Increase Alongside Rising Interest Rates (July 2004 ~ July 2007)

Contrary to the common expectation that stock prices would decline as interest rates rise, in this scenario, stock prices actually increased. This occurred because global economic growth, significantly driven by China's role as a major world manufacturer, outweighed the negative effects of higher interest rates.
</br></br></br>


### Scenario 2: Stock Prices Decrease Despite Lowering Interest Rates (March 2000 ~ November 2002)

In this scenario, stock prices fell sharply, even as interest rates were lowered. This downturn was due to the aftermath of the IT bubble burst and the 9/11 attacks, which had a more significant negative impact than the potential positive effects of lower interest rates.
</br></br></br>


### Scenario 3: Stock Prices Change in Correlation with Interest Rates (June 2018 ~ December 2019)

Here, economic growth remained solid. However, when the Federal Reserve increased interest rates, the overall effect on stock prices was negative. Conversely, when the interest rate was lowered on July 19th, the previously sustained high economic growth began to reflect in the stock market.
</br>

Hence to better understand stock market trends, it's crucial to consider economic growth alongside interest rates.
