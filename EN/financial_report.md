# The Secrets of Financial Reports

Korean brokerage firms issue more buy reports than sell reports. </br>
</br>
The main reasons are:
1. Relationship with the company
- External pressure
- Ban on entering the company and no sharing of corporate information
</br></br>

2. Nobody likes it
- **Institutions**: But I'm holding it
- **Investors**: But I'm also holding it
- **Brokerages**: It's burdensome
</br></br></br></br>


### Basic Terms 
- UNDERPER: Expected to be lower than the KOSPI index
- OUTPERFORM: Expected to rise above the KOSPI index
</br></br></br></br>


# How to Read Financial Reports
Buy reports only present the good aspects of a company,
but how can we read these reports and make wise investment decisions?
</br></br>

### 1. Look at the changes in the target price </br></br>
If the target price has been lowered compared to before, it means the analyst
- Has a negative view of the company
- Is less confident about its rise

Example) Target price downgraded (Kiwoom Securities 2022.05.06 KakaoBank)
</br></br>

### 2. Pay attention to what's read between the lines
- Analysts never vaguely express stocks they think are good.
</br></br>

Negative expressions (vaguely expressed)
- This year compared to next year
- Focusing on mid to long-term growth
- Taking a break
- A long-term approach is necessary
- A year to solidify fundamentals
- Even a thousand-mile journey begins with a single step
- You have to fold to survive
</br>

Positive expressions
- Only going up from here
- Too much good food at the feast
- Growth plate that doesn't close
</br></br>

### 3. Remember the purpose of the analyst writing the report and read accordingly
- Why do brokerages pay salaries to analysts? </br>
By issuing reports, they encourage more customers to participate in stock trading --> Increase in transaction fees --> Increase in brokerage profits
 
- Does issuing more sell reports increase credibility? </br>
Not necessarily. Sell reports can actually just increase customer trading volume, 
ultimately benefiting the brokerage but not providing trustworthy information to the customer.

- In the end... Use it only to gauge market sentiment </br>
I'm holding this stock, 
but this person views it this way.
Why do they see it like this?

- The number of views on a specific stock report = market interest
</br></br>
