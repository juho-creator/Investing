# The Cycle of Inflation

- If consumer prices are expected to rise -> Purchase in advance -> Increase in demand
- Therefore, increase in consumption = consumer price increase

# The Negative Impact of Inflation

</br>
The profit of a company which is calculated via excluding costs from a company's revenue, is returned to shareholders as dividends. </br>
However, if inflation causes a rapid increase in cost and corporate profits to decrease shareholders will be unsatisfied. </br>

For example, let's look at the negative impact of inflation caused by the oil shock (oil crisis) in the 1970s. </br>
OPEC (Oil Producing Countries) limited oil supply in response to the depreciation of the US dollar. </br>
This caused massive inflation ($2 -> $44 = Oil Crisis) </br>

As a result, consumer price increased rapidly, production costs rose, production activities contracted, and the economy slowed down. </br>

Therefore, bad inflation clearly becomes a disaster that ruins the economy. </br>
Hence central banks consider an annual 2% rise in prices to be appropriate.
</br></br>




# Deflationary Spiral

Deflation reduces investments from companies significantly. 
</br></br></br></br>




### Example

</br>
Let's assume you bought an apartment for 1 billion won using 300 million of your own money and 700 million in loans.
</br></br></br></br>

If deflation causes the house price to plummet from 1 billion to 500 million won, you would face a situation where your debt exceeds by 200 million won. </br>
Therefore, the fall in asset prices due to deflation makes the same debt of 700 million much more burdensome.

This is why the negative effect of deflation mentioned above can only be seen as poison in an economy with a lot of debt.
