# Types of Wages
- **Nominal Wage**: The amount of worker's wage expressed in monetary terms (not adjusted for inflation)
- **Real Wage**: The actual value of the wage amount (considering the impact of inflation)
</br></br></br></br>


# Calculating the Real Wage Growth Rate
```
Real Wage Growth Rate = Nominal Wage Growth Rate - Inflation Rate
```

</br>


### Example 1 </br>

You thought your salary increased by 100,000 won, but when calculating the real wage growth rate considering inflation, it is about 54,000 won.
Inflation deceives the real purchasing power of nominal money. We tend to consider nominal wages as real wages due to the false sense of stability numbers provide, thinking money is a fixed entity. This is known as **Money Illusion.**
</br></br>





### Example 2 </br>
Let's look at another example of money illusion

Which one is really better?
We might naturally think that a wage increase is better than a wage cut, but
when calculating the real wage considering inflation, both have a -7% real wage growth rate.

# Inflation

</br>

Due to inflation, the purchasing power of borrowed money decreases over time. 
This is referred to as **debt melting**.

Therefore, if you invest when the probability of asset price increases due to inflation and pay off the interest, 
the debtor makes money, but the person who lent 100 million will see a loss in the purchasing power of the principal due to inflation.

# Nominal Rate vs Real Rate
```
Real Rate = Nominal Rate - Inflation Rate
```

**Real Interest Rate for Depositors** </br>

</br></br>

**Real Interest Rate for Borrowers** </br>
Conversely, if you borrow 100 million at a 3.5% interest rate, then the real interest rate is 1.5%, meaning you are effectively paying an interest of 1.5 million won in real value, not 3.5 million won.
