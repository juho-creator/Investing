The Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes since 2022 to fight inflation, which peaked at 9.1%, have significantly impacted US Treasury bonds.

Though CPI has decreased from 9.1% to 3.5%, concerns remain that further Federal Reserve action to achieve a 2% CPI target could affect interest rates.

### Risks of Investing in TLT

1. **Inflation Uncertainty**: With CPI rising this year, there's a risk of persistent inflation. An increase in the interest rate by 1% could lead to a 16.34% decline in TLT due to its effective duration.
   
2. **Foreign Exchange Rate**: With the current exchange rate at 1USD = 1385.60KRW, a decrease in this rate could result in losses when converting profits from USD to KRW.

3. **US Treasury Bond Credibility**: Despite the US Dollar and Treasury's strong ratings (AAA~AA+), the US's high debt level ($34T, 121% of GDP) and China's selling of US Treasury bonds since 2022 raise concerns about the US's ability to repay its debts, potentially affecting bond values.
</br></br></br></br>

### Opportunities

- The effective duration of TLT suggests that a 1% interest rate change could result in a 16.7% price change. With interest rates at a 10-year high, this presents a unique investment opportunity.
- Dividends from TLT could increase with rising interest rates, providing income during periods of waiting for rates to decrease.
- The US Treasury bond maintains a high credit rating of AAA~AA+.
