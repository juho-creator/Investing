# Investing in TLT
TLT, 20+ year treasury bond ETF ran by blackrock has hit an all time low in 10years.
Currently, the price is down by  $90.29, equivalent to that of 2011.

The rise in interest rate by FED to combat inflation (with highest CPI being 9.1%) ever since 2022 has
caused the US treasury bond to plummet.


  According to the TLT ETF report from blackrock, the effective duration was around 16.7%.
Hence every 1% change in interest rate would cause TLT price change of 16.7%.


However, with the US CPI rising to 3.5%, there are concerns on rising  interest rates.
