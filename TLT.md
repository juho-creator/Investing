- TLT, 20+ year treasury bond ETF ran by blackrock has hit an all time low in 10years.
- Currently (15th April 2024), the price is down by  $90.29, equivalent to that of 2011.

- FED's series of rise in interest rate to combat inflation (with highest CPI being 9.1%) ever since 2022 has
caused the US treasury bond to plummet.

- Fortunately, the CPI came down from its peak of 9.1% down to 3.5%.
- However, with the US CPI rising to 3.5% in 2024, there are concerns on FED raising interest rates to reach its target CPI of 2%.
</br></br></br></br>





Regardless of the potential risk of raising interest rate, I still think there's alot of opportunity for the following reasons : 
- According to the TLT ETF report from blackrock, the effective duration was around 16.7%.
Hence every 1% change in interest rate would cause TLT price change of 16.7%. Considering the fact that interest rate has reached its all time high in 10years,
I see this as an opportunity that will not happen very often.
- Even if the interest rate were to rise, dividend of TLT would increase as well. Hence, since I'm planning to wait until interest comes down,
  I'll just be getting more dividend in the process of waiting.
- The US treasury bond has a trustworthy high credit rating of AAA~AA+,
